# Evaluation
always evaluate carefully before proposing the procedure, client lay but evidence not



relationship with lawyers 
very peculiar fase of the process, not based on tools or tech, reasoning and discussion
they aim at the creating the final result -> report or presentation to judge or court

evaluation: matching tha facts, data, things analazyd with type of crime in order to find the supporting elements of the components of theis crime
rhtoug this analysis we will need to contanstly talk in the ottics with lawyers / prosecutors 
the choice of the legal strategy -> lawyers do that
we need to do what elements are present and map those elemnts in the way lawyer wants
to defend the costumer- different than present all the evidence that we found
we have a duty to the lawyer, its their respjsabiliy to choose the way things will be prosecuted/for the defense
particular situation in which the techincal expert is more experencied in criminal cases related to CS that the lawyers

inbalance of expertise must be kept outsite the professional relatihion ship between lawyer-client ( its up to the lawyer)
even if the client its our client
if we disagree with the lawyer, resign!
trust and collaboration with all other profession 
balance of two things: while the costumer pays your bill, they DO NOT get to tell you what you write or say,
it is your poersonal responsability 
if someone dictates what you say, it is a terrible thing, it is a career ending mistake
thin line because of course acting as an expert witness you may find elements that do not go in favour of your client
they can be omitted from your report-> ethically accepted
you tell things useful for the defense
for the prosecutor it is not accepted 

we don't report a fact, we cannot lie about a fact 
state fatcs not opinion, not lie, we do not state the fact,
but never something contrary to the fact, or not a fact, or not scientific

in the context of analazing what happens in court: historical truth enlarging it to make it understing by people 
there is an historical truth
convinction and historical truth does not matter to you 
in court: process truth made of elements of present, experts, people-> not necessarly correct but it is in the process truth 
the process truth 


after a certain number of years the process decades-> the person free of guilt 
process designed to amminister punishiment
the fact that you think you are worjing for a good reason doesn't mean that -----

prosecutor is there to find the thuth in theory 
defense expert are needed-> morally corrupt by their client 
prosecution expert automatically emnjou a pass on their intention, morality
historically truth may tell you he is guikty as fuck, but this is not pthe point


sometimes we don'Ã¬t have evidence but reports of the evidence 

report: key element that we produce in our work 
in court the report has to be anakyszed 


what are we looking for: 
-mistakes
-omission
-metodology: reasing out about the metodology which of these things put on aobstacle to the judge


if the facts says something but the report ovestates what it means, os suggets something 


you can fair game .. the credibility of an expert 


the facts counts, the opinion not


Tyoical presentation errors 






TESTIMONY AS A witness


????

checking poreviour records of the judge 

CROSS-EXAMINATION is hostile 


Cloud: the reosources are shared

INCIDENT RESPONSE

in the case of forencisc. structure incident respons mechanics is importat to dive through further improvement of the system 
one of the requirements: importamt to learn and document
example: suppose there is an email worm 
and is exploiunt some vulnerabities and propagating
first issue: overloading network -> what can we do? disconnect the internet/company internet, shut down the email system

we have to find a trade off between the loss of functionality and containing of the incident
the person making this decision 

good incident response should indicate the action to take for an incident of this severity 
and specify the personnel who have the responsability to make decisions and detail how they can be quickly contacted

personal important to detect what is happening, keep a documentation and archive evidence
2 terms: 
-ARTIFACT: anaything that is out of place, that can be involved in an attack -> found analysing
-CSIRT: team 
PSIRT: product security -> on our product, response to out customer
-constituincy: who is CSIRT by this CSIRT
-incident
-triage
-vulnerability 

-detecting incident. detected in two ways
there is a system that reports, users that report something is happening or something is on 
finding something weird for example
users trained 

automated tools all work, effectiness depends on accuracy and correctness of the patters

the fact that an incident has happened means that the company could have done something better

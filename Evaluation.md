# Evaluation
always evaluate carefully before proposing the procedure, client lie but evidence not

relationship with lawyers 
very peculiar fase of the process, not based on tools or tech, reasoning and discussion
they aim at the creating the final result -> report or presentation to judge or court

evaluation: matching tha facts, data, things analazyd with type of crime in order to find the supporting elements of the components of thers crime
through this analysis we will need to contanstly talk in the ottics with lawyers / prosecutors 
the choice of the legal strategy -> lawyers do that
**we need to do what elements are present and map those elemnts in the way lawyer wants**
to defend the costumer- different than present all the evidence that we found
we have a duty to the lawyer, its their respjsabiliy to choose the way things will be prosecuted/for the defense
particular situation in which the techincal expert is more experencied in criminal cases related to CS that the lawyers

inbalance of expertise must be kept outsite the professional relatihion ship between lawyer-client ( its up to the lawyer)
even if the client its our client
if we disagree with the lawyer, resign!
trust and collaboration with all other profession 
balance of two things: while the costumer pays your bill, they DO NOT get to tell you what you write or say,
it is your poersonal responsability 
if someone dictates what you say, it is a terrible thing, it is a career ending mistake
thin line because of course acting as an expert witness you may find elements that do not go in favour of your client
they can be omitted from your report-> ethically accepted
you tell things useful for the defense
for the prosecutor it is not accepted 

we don't report a fact, we cannot lie about a fact 
state fatcs not opinion, not lie, we do not state the fact,
but never something contrary to the fact, or not a fact, or not scientific

in the context of analazing what happens in court: historical truth enlarging it to make it understing by people 
there is an historical truth
convinction and historical truth does not matter to you 
in court: process truth made of elements of present, experts, people-> not necessarly correct but it is in the process truth 
the process truth 


after a certain number of years the process decades-> the person free of guilt 
process designed to amminister punishiment
the fact that you think you are worjing for a good reason doesn't mean that -----

prosecutor is there to find the thuth in theory 
defense expert are needed-> morally corrupt by their client 
prosecution expert automatically emnjou a pass on their intention, morality
historically truth may tell you he is guilty as fuck, but this is not the point


sometimes we don'ìt have evidence but reports of the evidence 

report: key element that we produce in our work 
in court the report has to be analazyed 


what are we looking for: 
-mistakes
-omission
-metodology: reasing out about the metodology which of these things put on aobstacle to the judge


if the facts says something but the report ovestates what it means, os suggets something 
you can fair game .. the credibility of an expert 
the facts counts, the opinion not

when there are opinions that are not substiented by facts, those are things to point out. 
in techical reports facts count
experts should agree on the facts 


# Presentation 

Typical presentation errors: 
-acquisition 
  there are errors in the search and seizure, how it was concuted, the chain of custody, any breach in it has potentially exposed evidence to contamination, errores in the use of seals, of packaging of evidence. 
  the description of the materials, serial numbers do not match, we need the right numbers (eg hard drives) 
  id depends in che context, it could be the wrong drive because there is a miss handle of the evidence if we give it a meaning it is ok 
  cloning procedure, did they use write blockers, did they do it at the right time
  
  this should matter in a report, but you should not think only to this, the part that matters to us is the analysis
-analysis 
programs used that have defects for example

The reality is, unless you find mistakes!!!
the others are important for the members but they are not going to change everything, they don't change a fact. 


Instead the presentation and analysis errors, judge undestand them! 
the exploration of alternatives: did the author or report explore if things may have meant something else? 
if they connected things in an hyoptesis, are there any other hypotesis that explain the same thing? 
you should present tme, you show that the tecnical analysys aimed at something!

the danger is trojan defense: 
you have a computer, evidence is on a computer, (of a crime), now we know that malware(trojan)can allow someone else to control our computer to do things, so one alternative expl is a trojan ( I dind't do that) ! this is not unbeliavle 

what is the trouble with this cliche explanation? 
is not scientific-> is not falsifible, inside the theory you are theorizing there is not way to say that it was. 



## Report

1. Be clear
This is something that is lacking in engineers, we tend to be complete in what we say, that's how we build stuff. 
be concise. 
do not ezceed in english terminology. All technical terminology must be exmplained. You need to be simple without being simplistic and without giving the reader the imopression that you are simplyfing things for them. Don't over complicating things. 
2. You must exmplain why what you are saying is relevant to the reader. it is not obvious to them. 


The entire job is to convincere the judge. 

1. Model it on a scientific paper or report
  ○ Introduction - tell them everything you are going to say
  ○ Facts: same fact has introduction, why, what 
  ○ Discussion and analysis - each block with a small introduction saying what you want to explain and a conclusion summarizing what you just describe
   ○ Final conclusions where you leave out any doubtful statement: just distilled, iron truth(sequence of points) 
2. Structure it like an obstacle course, each obstacle a little taller than the previous one



### Structure 
1. **Foreword**: what I have examined which documents and these evidence sources, I was asked to report on X
2. **Introduction**: 
○ In this report, we are going to show A, B, C, D, and
these are all related to the question X because...
3. **Acquisition issues**
4. Preliminarily, we want to observe the following on
acquisition... Hashes were not computed, and therefore this, this and this could have happened (don’t stop at “computed.” and don’t count on chain of custody) JUDGES DO NOT CARE ABOUT PROCEDURE
 4. **On the technical analysis** Even ignoring all of our fundamental issues with the evidence integrity...The connection was not from A to B, but rather to C, this changes the reconstruction like this, and also makes these paragraphs of the adversarial report wrong (don’t stop at “C.”)Even ignoring these factual errors, the evidence is not best explained as the adversary did, but rather is much more compatible with these other explanations The following experiment has not been performed, or the following evidence is missing, and it could...
 5. **Conclusions**
 6. (the only thing most judges will consider)
○ In this report we have shown
■ Evidence was not properly acquired and thus these manipulations may have contaminated it
■ Item I did not happen as described, making conclusion C completely wrong (don’t fix it for them)
■ Theory T fits the facts better
■ Nobody checked if F was true or false, which
could have led to G
○ We must therefore conclude that ... (one strong, inevitable phrase)
 
in civil court the judge is going to name an external expert ( cosulente tencico d'ufficio in italia) 

 ### Testimony as a witness
 
The expert may be called as witness, in italy experts can only be called as witness. 
when the expert is called to perform the testimony-> sworn-> commit perjury! (crime) 
nor they can refuse to answer. 

### Direct examination

The expert witness is called as a witness by the friendly side, so the direct ex is friendy, the cross is hostile
prepare a script where you address the difficult thing that you want the opportunity to explain to the judge

### Cross-examination

INCIDENT RESPONSE

in the case of forencisc. structure incident respons mechanics is importat to dive through further improvement of the system 
one of the requirements: importamt to learn and document
example: suppose there is an email worm 
and is exploiunt some vulnerabities and propagating
first issue: overloading network -> what can we do? disconnect the internet/company internet, shut down the email system

we have to find a trade off between the loss of functionality and containing of the incident
the person making this decision 

good incident response should indicate the action to take for an incident of this severity 
and specify the personnel who have the responsability to make decisions and detail how they can be quickly contacted

personal important to detect what is happening, keep a documentation and archive evidence
2 terms: 
-ARTIFACT: anaything that is out of place, that can be involved in an attack -> found analysing
-CSIRT: team 
PSIRT: product security -> on our product, response to out customer
-constituincy: who is CSIRT by this CSIRT
-incident
-triage
-vulnerability 

-detecting incident. detected in two ways
there is a system that reports, users that report something is happening or something is on 
finding something weird for example
users trained 

automated tools all work, effectiness depends on accuracy and correctness of the patters

the fact that an incident has happened means that the company could have done something better

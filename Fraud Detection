### Fraud


supervised look inside the huge amount of data 
unserivised: how they behave. 
extract features from data 
such kind of systems are not enough , complement the system with supervised.
learn the diffrence between the known 

un vs sup .> you want to apply unservised every time you ahve a data set but not labeled
supervaside data with label legitimed and unlegitimed -> predict, detect and estimate some features

limitation of supervised learning techiques: is it not enough 

start knownladge from the domain 

antifraud detection system I have to consider the information I have available


start with unsupervised learning that extract novel patterns, once you have the investigation of the anaylist you start with data from the past, find pattern and then supervised 

Fraud managment cycle: 
Fraud detection -> detect it 
Fraud Investigation: every thing flagged as fraud must be investigate by humane EVERY TIME, in order to check if it is a really fraud or not, it's important, allows to understand the knowledgne to use for automted systems
Fraud Confirmation: not, ok this is not fraudolent, change the label, retrain your system, unless put and coferm the label and go on 
Fraud Prevention : now we have to prevent these transaction

feedback loop-> you have to automatize all these process and we will automatize this process-> you have to update all your models and systems (the supervised and unsupervised to mathc the new pattern)
